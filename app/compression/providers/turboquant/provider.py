# threadpoolctl's save/set/restore of the BLAS thread count is PROCESS-GLOBAL

# encode/decode/estimate across worker threads (asyncio.to_thread bounded by
# COMPRESSION_MAX_CONCURRENT), so unsynchronized threadpool_limits blocks
# would race: one thread's exit can restore the UNPINNED count while a sibling
# still computes (breaking the pin), or capture a sibling's pinned value as the
# "original" to restore (leaking the pin after all work ends). Serializing the
# whole limit-scoped BLAS section keeps both documented contracts -- pinned
# during the GEMM, restored after -- at the cost of serializing the BLAS calls
# themselves, which is acceptable: they are the CPU-bound section the pin
# exists to keep from oversubscribing.

class TurboQuantProvider:
    """TurboQuant compression provider.

    Accepts explicit construction parameters; falls back to the app-wide
    settings singleton when a parameter is left at its default ``None``.
    Mixing per-parameter overrides with settings defaults is supported:
    any parameter passed explicitly takes precedence; remaining
    parameters are read from settings.

    The ``seed`` parameter is load-bearing for codebook geometry and the
    rotation matrix. The settings layer always resolves it to a concrete
    non-negative integer (default 0); production deployments validate
    seed stability at the startup-validator layer via
    ``ConfigurationError`` (exit 78) when the env value diverges from
    the persisted ``compression_metadata`` row.

    Args:
        bits: Bit-width per coordinate; supported range is [2, 4]. When
            ``None``, reads ``settings.compression.bits``.
        variant: Compression variant identifier. When ``None``, reads
            ``settings.compression.variant``.
        seed: Rotation-matrix seed. When ``None``, reads

        dim: Vector dimension d. When ``None``, reads
