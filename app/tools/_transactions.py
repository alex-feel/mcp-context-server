    """Check if an exception is a transient DB error that is safe to retry.

    Despite the historical name, this classifier covers four transient
    families, all safe to retry because the database write that follows is
    idempotent (store_context deduplicates; update_context is a keyed
    partial update) and ALL embedding/summary/compression generation has
    already completed OUTSIDE the transaction (generation-first invariant) --
    so a retry re-runs only the rolled-back DB write and never regenerates or
    skips generation:

    1. Connection-level failures (the connection was lost, not a logical/data
       error): asyncpg.InterfaceError, asyncpg.ConnectionDoesNotExistError,
       ConnectionResetError, OSError -- EXCLUDING TimeoutError. TimeoutError is
       an OSError subclass on Python 3.12, but the pool-acquire TimeoutError that
       begin_transaction re-raises uncharged signals a SATURATED connection pool,
       not a lost connection: retrying it re-runs the full POSTGRESQL_POOL_TIMEOUT_S
       acquire wait each time, multiplying one saturation stall into several. So a
       saturated pool must fail fast at the tool layer after one bounded wait,
       matching execute_write's fail-fast handling of the identical signal.
    2. Statement / lock-wait timeouts: asyncpg.exceptions.QueryCanceledError
       (SQLSTATE 57014). PostgreSQL cancels the statement when it exceeds the
       connection's statement_timeout (set to ~0.9 * POSTGRESQL_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_S
       in app.backends.postgresql_backend.pool_callbacks.setup_pool_connection). Retrying with the SAME ceiling
       only helps a TRANSIENT lock-WAIT (the write was blocked behind a
       concurrent writer and the contention has since cleared); it does NOT
       help a write that is fundamentally slower than the ceiling -- for that
       case (notably fp32 mode, ENABLE_EMBEDDING_COMPRESSION=false, where each
       per-chunk INSERT performs in-transaction HNSW maintenance) the operator
       must also raise POSTGRESQL_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_S or keep compression ON. See
       docs/database-backends.md.
    3. Transaction-rollback failures: asyncpg.exceptions.TransactionRollbackError
       (SQLSTATE class 40 -- deadlock_detected 40P01, serialization_failure 40001,
       and siblings). PostgreSQL aborts one transaction to break a deadlock or a
       serialization cycle; by definition the loser is expected to retry, and the
       retry succeeds once the competing transaction has committed. Without this
       class a deadlock (e.g. two atomic update batches that lock the same rows in
       opposite order) is neither a ControlFlowError nor a connection error, so it
       would charge the circuit breaker instead of retrying -- turning a routine,
       self-clearing lock cycle into an outage.

    4. SQLite write contention: sqlite3.OperationalError in the SQLITE_BUSY /
       SQLITE_LOCKED family ('database is locked'), classified by the shared
       is_sqlite_locked_error predicate. The backend's write-queue path
       (execute_write) retries this family internally, but begin_transaction --
       the path every store/update transaction site uses -- bypasses the write
       queue and performs NO backend-level retry, so a cross-process lock
       collision (e.g. two MCP server processes sharing one SQLite database
       file) must be retried by these tool-layer loops, mirroring the
       PostgreSQL class-40 treatment above. The backend re-raises the family
       without charging the circuit breaker for the same reason.

    QueryCanceledError is PostgreSQL-only; the isinstance check is harmless on
    SQLite, which never raises it.

        metadata_patch: Metadata merge patch or None.
        summary: New summary or None.
        clear_summary: Whether to clear existing summary.
        visibility: New visibility value or None. The caller validates the
            value and authorizes the change (owner-only) BEFORE the
            transaction; here it simply rides the update_context_entry write,
            so it participates in the same compare-and-set as text/metadata.
        tags: New tags or None.
        images: Raw images parameter from caller (for None vs empty detection).
        validated_images: Validated image list (empty if images is None).
        chunk_embeddings: Regenerated embeddings or None.
        embedding_model: Model name for embedding storage.
        index_nodes: Replacement index_tree node rows; None leaves the stored
            rows untouched, an empty list clears them.
        expected_version: Optimistic-concurrency token captured before
            generation; None skips the compare-and-set.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (updated_fields, summary_cleared):
        - updated_fields: List of field names that were updated
        - summary_cleared: True if summary was cleared (for response message)

    Raises:
        EntryNotFoundError: If the target entry does not exist -- update_context_entry
            or patch_metadata reports no matching row, or the tags-only / images-only
            path finds the parent missing. A ControlFlowError, so the failed write is
            not charged to the circuit breaker; the caller catches it outside the
            transaction and converts it to a not-found ToolError.
