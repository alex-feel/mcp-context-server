    """Sanitize query tokens into crash-safe SQLite FTS5 terms.

    SQLite FTS5 MATCH treats AND/OR/NOT/NEAR as case-sensitive operators and rejects bare
    special characters, so an unsanitized token can raise ``fts5: syntax error`` in match,
    prefix, or boolean-OR contexts. Each token is made safe and aligned with PostgreSQL's
    plainto_tsquery for the CONFIGURED language (which ANDs the remaining lexemes and, for a
    language whose ASCII words route through ``english_stem``, drops the operator stopwords):

    - A quoted-phrase token (``"..."``) is preserved as-is.
    - An operator bareword (and/or/not, case-insensitive) is DROPPED only when ``language`` is one
      whose PostgreSQL config treats them as stopwords (english/hindi/russian -- see
      ``_ENGLISH_STOPWORD_FTS_LANGUAGES``); for every other language it is KEPT as a literal term,
      because PostgreSQL keeps it as a required lexeme and dropping it on SQLite alone would make
      the two backends return different rows.
    - A bare term carrying an embedded double quote is SPLIT on that quote into one FTS5 string
      literal per fragment (``cat"dog`` -> ``"cat" "dog"``), which FTS5 ANDs. Escaping the quote by
      doubling it instead (``"cat""dog"``) does NOT neutralize it: FTS5 re-tokenizes the content of
      a string literal, the escape decodes back to a literal ``"``, and the tokenizer treats it as
      a word boundary -- silently turning an ordinary token into a strict two-word ADJACENCY
      phrase. PostgreSQL's plainto_tsquery splits the same input into independently-ANDed lexemes
      with no adjacency requirement, so only the split form keeps the backends returning the same
      rows.
    - A HYPHEN inside a bare term stays a space inside ONE literal (``full-text`` ->
      ``"full text"``, an adjacency phrase) on purpose: PostgreSQL emits the compound lexeme
      ``full-text`` plus its parts, which requires the two words to be adjacent in the document.
      FTS5's unicode61/porter tokenizer drops hyphens entirely, so the document side cannot
      distinguish ``full-text`` from ``full text`` at all; the adjacency phrase is the closest
      expressible approximation, and ANDing the parts separately would widen recall further.
      This rule is scoped to the modes THIS function serves (match and the hybrid OR join),
      where PostgreSQL's compound lexeme is what sets the adjacency target. PREFIX mode has a
      different target -- ``_handle_hyphenated_prefix_postgresql`` emits AND-ed prefix lexemes
      (``full:* & text:*``) with no adjacency requirement -- so the prefix branch of
      ``transform_query_sqlite`` splits hyphens into separate wildcarded literals instead.
    - Every other bare term is wrapped as an FTS5 string literal, so an operator-cased NEAR or a
      special char ( ( ) : * ^ ) is a LITERAL term, never syntax. A quoted single word is still
      tokenized/stemmed, so ordinary-word recall is unchanged.

    Shared by the standalone FTS transform (``transform_query_sqlite`` match/prefix modes) and
    the hybrid adaptive query builder so the two never diverge.

        tokens: Raw whitespace/quote tokens from the query.
