    """Return why a SQLite value cannot be stored on the PostgreSQL target, else None.

    An embedded NUL (U+0000) or unpaired UTF-16 surrogate is legal in a SQLite
    TEXT value but fatal on PostgreSQL: asyncpg rejects a NUL text bind
    (``CharacterNotInRepertoireError``, SQLSTATE 22021) and an unpaired surrogate
    is not UTF-8-encodable at all. A ``jsonb`` column has a second failure mode --
    the store path serializes a metadata NUL as the JSON escape ``\\u0000`` (six
    ASCII characters, not a literal byte), which passes the raw-string check yet
    is rejected by PostgreSQL's jsonb parser (SQLSTATE 22P05). A ``jsonb`` column
    has a THIRD failure mode: a non-finite JSON number. ``json.loads`` accepts the
    non-standard tokens ``NaN``/``Infinity``/``-Infinity`` AND silently converts a
    standard-but-overflowing literal such as ``1e400`` into ``inf``, while
    ``json.dumps`` -- which :func:`rewrite_metadata_references` applies to every
    parseable ``metadata`` value on the copy path -- re-emits those values as the
    invalid tokens the jsonb parser rejects. Such a value is also unstorable
    through the server's own store boundary, which runs the same
    :func:`app.metadata_types.non_finite_metadata_error` guard, so a v3 target must
    not receive it either way.

    Accordingly this runs the shared
    :func:`app.metadata_types.unstorable_string_error` walker on the raw
    serialized string (catching a literal NUL/surrogate in the bind) and, for a
    ``jsonb`` column, ALSO on the decoded structure (``json.loads`` restores the
    ``\\u0000`` escape to a real U+0000 the walker detects) plus the shared
    non-finite-number guard on that same decoded structure. For a ``jsonb`` column
    a value ``json.loads`` cannot parse is itself unstorable: the target binds it
    through a ``$n::jsonb`` cast
    that PostgreSQL rejects mid-transaction (SQLSTATE 22P02), aborting the whole
    migration with no row identification -- the exact failure this pre-check
    exists to convert into a skip-and-warn -- so malformed JSON returns a reason
    rather than passing as storable. (A raw TEXT column has no such cast, so
    unparseable content is not rejected there.)

    Args:
        value: The raw SQLite column value (already serialized to a JSON string
            for a ``jsonb`` column), or ``None``.
        is_jsonb: True when ``value`` is bound into a PostgreSQL ``jsonb`` column,
            enabling the decoded-escape and non-finite-number checks in addition
            to the raw-string check.

# and idx_tags_tag in its base schema and therefore cannot already hold a value that
# breaches the ceiling. An INDEXED METADATA value is different, and a PostgreSQL
# source can hold one: the metadata expression indexes are deliberately NOT in the
# base schema (see app/schemas/postgresql_schema.sql -- a database initialized only by
# this CLI has none until its first server startup), so a source whose
# METADATA_INDEXED_FIELDS never covered a field, or which was never started as a
# server, can carry a value the target's index rejects.

# the NUL/surrogate pre-check exists to convert into a per-row skip-and-warn.

# compresses an index attribute larger than 512 bytes in line, so a highly repetitive
# oversized value can still fit while an incompressible one of the same length cannot.
# Modeling that compression is not possible from here, and the two errors are not

      holds ``{"priority": "high"}`` under an integer-typed field, and the cast is where
      that stops being portable.
