"""PostgreSQL entry point for the real-server integration suite.

Runs the shared backend-parametrized harness
(:class:`tests.integration._harness.MCPServerIntegrationTest`) against a REAL
MCP server subprocess backed by PostgreSQL, giving PostgreSQL the same
end-to-end tool-surface coverage as SQLite. The identical assertion methods
execute against the asyncpg backend, exercising PG-specific SQL paths that have
no SQLite equivalent: tsvector/tsquery FTS, the pgvector ``<->`` / HNSW /
``DISTINCT ON`` vector search, jsonb metadata operators (``->>`` / ``@>`` /
``jsonb_typeof``), native-UUID dedup interleaving ordering, ``Decimal`` ->
float statistics coercion, the ``jsonb_merge_patch`` deep-merge function, and
the asyncpg UUID type codec.

The run uses an ISOLATED database (``pg_parity_db``) rather than the shared
``mcp_test`` database, so it is independent of the schema mutations and the
seed-locked ``compression_metadata`` singleton that the dedicated compression
round-trip tests apply to ``mcp_test``. The harness runs the fp32 vector layout
(``ENABLE_EMBEDDING_COMPRESSION=false``); the compressed PG path is covered by
``test_compression_round_trip.py`` and ``test_search_compressed_postgresql.py``.

Embedding/semantic/hybrid sub-tests self-gate on Ollama model availability
inside the harness, so the suite degrades gracefully (skip-as-pass) when no
model is present; FTS runs unconditionally (native tsvector, no model needed).
