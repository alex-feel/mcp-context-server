"""Regression tests for the CI job-skip conditions in .github/workflows.

Every quality gate (tests, pre-commit, MCP marker validation, Trivy security scan)
carries a job-level ``if:`` that exempts Release Please's own version-bump pull
request. The exemption must be authenticated by something the pull-request
submitter cannot control.

Two values were available. ``github.head_ref`` is the branch name, which a
contributor picks freely on a fork, so it is only safe when paired with an author
check. ``github.event.head_commit.message`` on the push-to-main event is worse:
depending on the repository's merge-message settings it embeds the fork branch
name, the pull-request title, or the squashed commit bodies, so it can be made to
contain any literal string a match looks for -- there is no way to authenticate the
release bot from it, and a matching push skipped pre-commit, the MCP checks and the
security scan (including its SARIF upload) on the default branch.

These tests are structural: they read the workflow files and pin the invariants, so
reintroducing an untrusted-string skip fails here rather than silently degrading the
signal a reviewer relies on.

Conditions are extracted with a real YAML parser rather than by matching lines. A
line-oriented reader has to re-derive scalar boundaries that YAML already defines,
and every shape it gets wrong makes a condition arrive TRUNCATED or EMPTY -- at
which point the substring assertions below still pass, on text that no longer
contains the thing they were written to reject. A multi-line plain scalar, a value
that begins on the line after the key, a block header carrying a trailing comment,
and a multi-line quoted scalar are all valid YAML and all defeat that approach.
PyYAML is a hard dependency of fastmcp, so parsing properly costs nothing here.
